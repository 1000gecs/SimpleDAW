# Simple DAW

## A Small Digital Audio Workstation

****

**Purpose:** \
Simple DAW is a Digital Audio Workstation that will allow users to create simple sounds.
Users will be able to save and load previously saved soundtracks to play or edit.

The Features are As Follows:
- Create simple soundtracks with one or more sounds at different pitches.
- Save the soundtrack to the file system.
- Load previously made soundtracks.

**Who is Simple DAW Made For?:** \
Simple DAW is made for people who want to experience what digital creation of music is 
like, without the complexities of DAWs such as Ableton Live or FLStudio.

**Why Did I Create Simple DAW:** \
I am interested in creating Simple DAW because of my minor hobbies in music production.
My personal DAW of choice is Ableton Live. When I am *producing* in Ableton I sometimes 
think of how certain features were designed and implemented. Simple DAW is my approach 
to create a much simpler DAW and gain some sort of knowledge on how complex programs, such 
as Ableton, were designed.

## Phase 4: Task 3
I would refactor the Main class into the GUI class, this would then change the GUI class 
to start the program. That would also result in me moving the Event and EventLog classes to 
the GUI class.

I would also remove the edit class. This would refactor all the edit functionality into the EditNote
class. The idea was to have other panels for editing in the Edit panel, but I was not able 
to add any more features given the time constraints.
